Hello there!

I am a Physics and Computer Science double major from UC Berkeley, currently conducting research
under Dr. Yen-Yung Chang. I enjoy playing piano, climbing and occasionally I play some badminton. 
Below is a list of projects I've completed (and some are still ongoing), please check them out! 

## CS 180

This is a computer vision course I took in Fall 2024. All projects except project 5 were completed using
Python's `scikit-image` library, using algorithms learned in class.   

[Project 1: Coloring the Prokudin-Gorskii Collection](./project-1/index.md)  
[Project 2: Fun with Filters and Frequencies](./project-2/index.md)   
[Project 3: Face Morphing](./project-3/index.md)   
[Project 4: Image Warping and Mosaicing, Autostitching](./project-4/index.md)   
[Project 5: The Power of Diffusion MOdels](./project-5/index.md)   
[Final Project: Light Field Camera, Gradient Fusion](./final-project/index.md)   

## Coursework

Most of the work that I completed in college (course notes,
homeworks, etc.) are available in my [courses repo](https://github.com/ericdu03/Courses), save for some
courses which do not allow me to share such resources. I've also taken course notes for several classes,
which are available for download here:

[Physics 110B: Electromagnetism and Optics II](/notes/110B.pdf)    
[CS 170: Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems](/notes/170.pdf)

## Physics Notes

I am currently collaborating with Andrew Binder, a former Berkeley student, on a project to consolidate all
of our physics notes we've taken together into a single website and make it available for all students. Go
